## ✨ Key Features

-   **Hybrid Image Encoder**: Combines a `timm` backbone with a novel spatial attention module for enhanced feature extraction.
-   **Hybrid Text Encoder**: Uses `Transformers` with custom semantic enhancement layers for deeper text understanding.
-   **Cross-Modal Fusion**: Employs interactive attention and adaptive gating to effectively merge vision and text modalities.
-   **Multi-Task Learning**: Natively supports similarity, contrastive, reconstruction, and classification tasks out of the box.
-   **Stability Improvements**: Integrated with robust error handling, gradient clipping, and numerical stability checks.
-   **W&B Integration**: Comprehensive experiment tracking with Weights & Biases for monitoring losses, metrics, and configurations.

## ⚙️ Installation

Get the project up and running on your local machine with these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/theimma1/labelee-foundation-model.git](https://github.com/theimma1/labelee-foundation-model.git)
    cd labelee-foundation-model
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    conda create -n labelee-env python=3.9
    conda activate labelee-env
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up Weights & Biases** (optional):
    ```bash
    wandb login
    ```
    Then update `configs/base_config.py` with your W&B username and project details.

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

Run the main training script with the default configuration:

```bash
python scripts/labelee_training.py
Custom Training Example
You can easily instantiate and use the model in your own scripts.

Python

from src.new_Labelee_model import create_labelee_foundation
# from src.data_loader import create_dataloaders # Assuming you build this

# Create model with a custom configuration
custom_config = {
    'vision_model_name': 'vit_large_patch16_224',
    'text_model_name': 'bert-base-uncased',
    'feature_dim': 1024,
    'num_classes': 1000
}
model, tokenizer = create_labelee_foundation(custom_config)

# Create dataloaders
# train_loader, val_loader = create_dataloaders(tokenizer, batch_size=32)

# ... your training loop here ...
🧠 Model Architecture
Key Components
SpatialAttentionModule: A novel attention mechanism applied directly to image features to focus on relevant spatial areas.
HybridImageEncoder: A powerful encoder that combines the robustness of a pre-trained TIMM backbone with our custom spatial attention processing.
HybridTextEncoder: An enhanced transformer that uses multi-granularity aggregation for superior semantic understanding.
CrossModalFusionNetwork: An interactive fusion block where vision and text features iteratively refine one another through attention.
MultiTaskLoss: A flexible, weighted combination of multiple loss functions (BCE, Cross-Entropy, MSE) to handle diverse pre-training objectives.
📈 Training & Experiments
Running Training
The main training logic is in scripts/labelee_training.py. You can modify the default configuration in configs/base_config.py to change:

Model architecture (e.g., vision_model_name, text_model_name)
Training hyperparameters (epochs, batch_size, learning_rate)
Loss weights and the active pre-training task
Monitoring with W&amp;B
If enabled, all training progress will be logged to your Weights & Biases dashboard, including:

Loss curves (total loss and per-task loss)
Validation metrics
Model gradients and parameters
System hardware utilization
Model Checkpoints
Checkpoints are automatically saved to a checkpoints/ directory during training. You can load a trained model using:

Python

import torch
from src.new_Labelee_model import LabeleeFoundation

model = LabeleeFoundation() # Ensure config matches the saved model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoints/best_model.pth'))
model.eval()
